Javascript and its close relative Jquery are responsible for much of the fun and/or interactive stuff that we see on the web. These tools often are used to turn a static webpage into something much more dynamic. Just like CSS, Javascript and Jquery often are contained in distinct files and have to be added to a webpage in order for it to function properly.
